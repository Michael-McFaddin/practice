# Use a while, each and map for each problem.

#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9].
# arr = [1, 2, 3]
# new_arr = []
# i = 0

# p new_arr

#  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string upcased.
#     For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["HELLO", "GOODBYE"].
# str_arr = ["hello", "goodbye"]
# new_str_arr = []
# i = 0

# p new_str_arr

#  3. Start with an array of objects and create a new array of string values from each object's :name key.
#     For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes ["Alice", "Blane"].
# name_arr = [{ name: "Alice", age: 27 }, { name: "Blane", age: 16 }]
# just_name_arr = []
# i = 0

# p just_name_arr

#  4. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string's first letter only and the length of the string.
#     For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["h", 5, "g", 7].
# arr = ["hello", "goodbye"]
# first_ltr_len = []
# i = 0

# p first_ltr_len

# 5.  Start with an array of objects and create a new array of number values from each object's :age key times 2.
#     For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes [54, 32].
# people = [{ name: "Alice", age: 27 }, { name: "Blane", age: 16 }]
# age_times2 = []
# i = 0

# p age_times2
#_____________________________________________________
# Use a while, each and filter for each question below.

#  6. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 20.
#     For example, [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3] becomes [2, 18, 12, 3].
#  nums = [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3];
#  lessThan20 = [];
#  i = 0;

#  7. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that start with the letter "w".
#     For example, ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"] becomes ["winner", "winner"].
#  wordArr = ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"];
#  wArr = [];
#  i = 0;

#  8. Start with an array of objects and create a new array with only the objects with prices greater than 5 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}].
#  items = [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}];
#  itemsUnder5 = [];
#  i = 0;

#  9. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the even numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [2, 4, 8].
#  nums = [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7];
#  evenNums = [];
#  i = 0;

#  10. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that don't start with the letter "b".
#     For example, ["big", "little", "good", "bad"] becomes ["little", "good"].
#  words = ["big", "little", "good", "bad"];
#  noB = [];
#  i = 0;

# Use

# 11. Use a nested loop to convert an array of number pairs into a single flattened array.
#    For example, [[1, 3], [8, 9], [2, 16]] becomes [1, 3, 8, 9, 2, 16].
#  numArr = [[1, 3], [8, 9], [2, 16]];
#  flatArr = [];
#  i = 0;

# 12. Use a nested loop with two arrays of numbers to create a new array of the sums of each combination of numbers.
#    For example, [1, 2] and [6, 7, 8] becomes [7, 8, 9, 8, 9, 10].
#  nums1 = [1, 2];
#  nums2 = [6, 7, 8];
#  sums = [];
#  i = 0;

# 13. Use a nested loop to find the largest sum of any two different numbers within an array.
#    For example, [1, 8, 3, 10] becomes 18.

# 14. Use nested loops with an array of numbers to compute a new array containing the first two numbers (from the original array) that add up to the number 10. If there are no two numbers that add up to 10, return false.
#    For example, [2, 5, 3, 1, 0, 7, 11] becomes [3, 7].

#15. Use a nested loop to convert an array of string arrays into a single string.
#    For example, [["a", "man"], ["a", "plan"], ["a", "canal"], ["panama"]] becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama".
